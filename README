ajak's gentoo scripts



stablereq-python-check.sh checks for stablereqs for a given atom or atoms. When
called with the `-f` flag, the script will treat its input as a file rather
than an atom, and it will search for the atoms listed in the file. Note that
stdin is a file and when piping into this script the `-f` flag is necessary.

It outputs csv with columns "atom,stablereq bug number,available python impls".
If the script finds no stablereqs, "none" is printed in the second column for
easy grepability.

For example, to see the packages that need to be stabilized for a Python
upgrade:

$ gpy-upgrade-impl -s python3_6 python3_7 | ./stablereq-python-check.sh -f | tee 36-to-37-stablereq.csv
app-admin/abrt,717916,3.6 3.7
app-backup/untangle-https-backup,none,3.6 3.7 3.8
app-doc/doxygen,702610,3.6 3.7 3.8
app-emacs/pymacs,721740,2.7 3.6 3.7 3.8
app-i18n/ibus-hangul,721742,3.6 3.7
...snip...

And to check which packages need stablereqs:

$ grep none 36-to-37-stablereq.csv
app-backup/untangle-https-backup,none,3.6 3.7 3.8
app-i18n/transifex-client,none,3.6 3.7 3.8
app-misc/trash-cli,none,3.6 3.7 3.8
app-office/unoconv,none,3.6 3.7 3.8
app-portage/elogviewer,none,3.6 3.7 3.8
app-portage/overlint,none,3.6 3.7 3.8
...snip...
