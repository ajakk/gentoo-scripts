ajak's gentoo scripts



gpyutils-check-for-stablereqs.sh should be called with an argument of either
'36-to-37' or '37-to-38' and it will fetch the relevant gpyutils stablereq file.

Its output is csv, with columns "atom,stablereq bug number,available python
impls". If the script finds no stablereqs, "none" is printing in the second
column for easy grepability. Currently, Gentoo is on the tail end of updating
to Python 3.7. If the script's output for the 36-to-37 data is put into a file
'foo', then we can easily see which packages need stablereqs:

$ grep "none.*3\.7" foo
app-misc/bar,none,3.6 3.7
